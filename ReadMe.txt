Hi Tumey :D

Currently, this program can hold a list of pictures for a user.  Then, you may view the pictures by clicking on gallery and then clicking on a list item that pops up.  You can right click on the picture to delete it, or click on it to view the information.  Then, you can log out. 

Unfortunately, I cannot add any photos at this moment.  However, there are some photos added to the user Brandon.  So all you have to do is create a new account called Brandon with any passward you want, and you should be able to view some pictures.

The database has been recreated in a .mdf file that can be accessed via sql express or connected via visual studio.  

Accessing the database was all re-written in linq statements and really improved the maintainability of my code while also eliminating any sql attacks and improving performance by at least 56%!

Just go ahead to the published folder and run the setup file to install the application. It should install under C:\program files\DarkCloud2Inventor



Warm Regards,
Brandon Ramirez
